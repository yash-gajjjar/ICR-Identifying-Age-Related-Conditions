### About:
The Identifying Age-Related Conditions competition focuses on predicting whether a person has one or more of three specific medical conditions or none based on health measurement data. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can reliably predict the presence of these conditions to aid in faster diagnosis and reduce the need for invasive and time-consuming medical procedures.

Aging is a significant risk factor for various health conditions such as heart disease, dementia, and arthritis. Accurately predicting the likelihood of a person developing these conditions can significantly improve medical interventions, especially in bioinformatics, where data science plays a key role in developing new predictive methods.

### Problem Statement:
Participants are required to build a model that can predict whether a person has:

Class 1: One or more of three specific medical conditions.
Class 0: None of the three medical conditions.
The challenge lies in accurately predicting the classification based on a set of health measurements, some of which are difficult to obtain without medical tests. By using predictive models, we aim to reduce the intrusiveness of diagnosis, streamline the medical process, and maintain patient privacy.
